# data-base-movie4u

to run just simply run the main.py 
(there may be a problem when creating user table if you encounter it create it manualy at user:movie4u password:test1234 and rerun the script)


**if you encounter problem and want to run it manually first run fonction1.sql in admin then login into user:movie4u password:test1234 and run database.sql then fonction2.sql**
